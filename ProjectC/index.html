  <h1>Food insecurity grows in New York City's post-pandemic landscape</h1>
  <h3>By Lara Heard</h3>
  <p></p>
  <p> 20 months have passed since New York first went into lockdown. But New Yorkers are still suffering the effects of the pandemic, including heightened rates of food insecurity.</p>

  <p>According to data from the Human Resources Administration, food pantry usage increased by about 94% between the first and second quarters of 2020. That trend has continued into 2021; between April and June, usage rates were 144% higher than during the same months of 2019.

<p>The effects of the pandemic on New Yorkers' food security came swiftly. In May 2021, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/21/860312565/in-new-york-city-2-million-residents-face-food-insecurity-officials-say">according to NPR,</a> Mayor de Blasio announced at a daily briefing that the number of food insecure individuals was estimated to have doubled from about 1 million to 2 million following the pandemic. Food Bank For NYC <a href="https://1giqgs400j4830k22r3m4wqg-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Fighting-More-Than-Covid-19_Research-Report_Food-Bank-For-New-York-City_6.09.20_web.pdf">attributes</a> this rise to a combination of multiple conditions, each conducive to food insecurity, including high unemployment and inflated food prices. Food insecurity disproportionately impacts New Yorkers of color.</p>
<p>This increase comes despite measures taken during the pandemic to improve food access. According to a CUNY Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy <a href="https://sph.cuny.edu/life-at-sph/news/2020/10/14/food-insecurity-covid-release/">survey</a>, New Yorkers' usage of SNAP benefits greatly increased between April and September. Many respondents were also taking advantage of the city schools' Grab and Go Food program.</p>
<p>But providing food access to New Yorkers will require more than just a reversal of pandemic era harm. In a written testimony regarding hunger in New York City, Charles Platkin, Executive Director of the Hunter College New York City Food Policy Center, <a href="https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/testimony-on-the-status-of-hunger-in-nyc-and-the-impact-of-covid/">wrote</a> that "Our aim cannot be to return to the pre-pandemic normal, as that would still leave approximately 1.2 million people hungry and food insecure."</p>
<p>Instead, Platkin called for "long-term solutions to ensure that all New Yorkers have access to healthy, nutritious meals at home, at school, and at work."</p>
